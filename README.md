# Computer Graphics Lab Project: A Car in The Road
A Car in The Road is an interactive 3D simulation of a car on a textured road based on JavaScript and Three.js, developed as part of the CSE4204-Computer Graphics Lab course at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology.. The project integrates a range of animation, texture mapping, perspective projection, and user interactions via mouse and keyboard inputs.

## Technologies Used:
- WebGL: A JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser.
- Three.js: A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rafi99-bat/A-Car-in-The-Road`
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. If using Visual Studio Code, open VS Code as administrator.
4. Run the following commands in Terminal:
    * For Three.js:
    ```
    npm install --save three
    ```
    * For Vite:
    ```
